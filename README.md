# ShadowSocksGUI
## Introduction
This is a graphical user interface that controls shadowsocks proxy connection on client side <br/>
This app is designed to replace ```Shadowsocks-Qt5``` at ```https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-qt5```, since it's out of dated , no longer maintained and having a lot of trouble running on Newer version of Ubuntu. <br/>
In current version, this app is only a interface that controls shadowsocks, meaning that it does not have shadowsocks core integrated inside the app, so you will have to download dependecys, read below<br/>
